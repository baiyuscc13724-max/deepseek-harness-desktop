 * the lease treats it as a fixed right-edge offset, reserves

 * `right: offset` — the device panel sits immediately left of the other

 * the panel to re-measure).
 *
 * @param root - the app root element (`#root`) the panel pushes over.
 * @param owner - stable lease owner id; a different owner of OUR attribute
 *   makes the claim fail (the surface falls back to its overlay variant).
 * @param initialWidth - panel width in px reserved through the root margin.
 * @param computedMarginRight - current computed margin-right (0 = unclaimed).
 * @param viewportWidth - used to refuse coexistence when the foreign sidebar

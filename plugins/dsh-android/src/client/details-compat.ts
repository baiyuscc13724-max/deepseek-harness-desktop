/**
 * Compatibility boundary for DSH builds that declare a keyed per-tool details
 * seat (the Codex-style right details panel).
 *
 * The installed rc.6 runtime does NOT declare `tool.details.toolview` — its
 * tool package only declares `tool.call.toolview`, and the details column
 * body is the single-occupant `conversation.details.tool` seat (declared by
 * dsh-client-ui-conversation, "one occupant, so taking it means rendering
 * every tool's output"). Mirroring dsh-ios/dsh-openpencil, this module keeps
 * the proposed additive contract local: at runtime `ctx.slots.inject()`
 * simply waits while the slot is absent, so on rc.6 the plugin's page-owned
 * right panel host (android-panel-host) carries the surface instead. A future
 * supporting host activates the native seat without code changes, and the
 * panel host's row-click trigger steps aside when it sees the declaration.
